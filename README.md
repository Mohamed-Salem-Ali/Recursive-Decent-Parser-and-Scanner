# Recursive-Decent-Parser-and-Scanner
This project is an implementation of a compiler for Proj3 language and this  project includes two phases, scanner phase (Lexical analysis) which appears and  encounters lexical errors and parser phase (Syntax analysis) which appears and  encounters syntax errors. Also, this project includes a counter which counts number  of tokens, number of lexical errors and number of syntax error in the test program.  This project use Hand Coded (Loop and Switch) method for implementing scanner  and use Recursive Descent algorithm for implementing parser and generating many different testing programs and test project thoroughly using different set of proj3
